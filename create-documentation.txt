Certainly! Below is the README content:

Application Description
This application provides a simple yet robust interface allowing users to submit their personal details via a form. Built using React and Redux Toolkit, it boasts of modern reactive paradigms and state management techniques. Users are prompted to enter their first name, last name, email, and a brief message. To ensure accuracy and prevent spam, all inputs undergo rigorous validation checks. On successful submission, the details are stored and can be viewed in a list, showcasing the seamless integration of components and state.

The design is meticulously crafted to be responsive, with fields adjusting to half the viewport's width. Should there be any validation issues, the application is intuitive enough to highlight the problematic fields and provide the necessary feedback. This ensures users are guided correctly in submitting their details, making the experience pleasant and straightforward.

To get the application up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository_url]
Navigate to the Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd [repository_name]
